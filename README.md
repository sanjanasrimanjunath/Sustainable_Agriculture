“AI-powered Precision Fertilizer & Pesticide Recommendation System for Sustainable Agriculture".<br>

🔹 Abstract

The model aims to build a machine learning–based software platform that helps farmers adopt sustainable farming practices by recommending the optimal fertilizer and pesticide usage.
Using datasets of soil nutrients, crop type, weather conditions, and historical pest/disease occurrences, the system predicts:

Nutrient requirements of crops.

Risk of pest/disease infestation.

Sustainable (eco-friendly) fertilizer and pesticide usage plan.

The solution will be demonstrated through an online dashboard/web app, where users (farmers or students) can select crop type, enter soil and weather details, and receive AI-generated recommendations.

This project highlights the role of ML in Sustainable Agriculture, reducing chemical overuse, improving yield, and promoting green skills in farming.


🚀 Features:

✅ Fertilizer suggestions (chemical + eco-friendly alternatives).

✅Pest reduction suggestions

✅ Sustainability tips for climate-smart agriculture.

✅ Interactive Streamlit web app for easy farmer use.

✅ Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.




📊 Workflow

1. Collect soil & weather parameters (N, P, K, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall).


2. Fertilizer recommendation engine suggests chemical & eco-friendly options.


3. Sustainability module provides farming tips.



🌍 Impact

This project helps farmers:

Improve crop yield.

Reduce overuse of fertilizers.

Gets Pesticides Recommendation.

Adopt eco-friendly & sustainable practices.
